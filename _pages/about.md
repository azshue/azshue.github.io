## About me     
   I am a fifth-year Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Maryland, College Park (UMD). As a research assistant at UMD, I work with Dr. [Tom Goldstein](https://www.cs.umd.edu/~tomg/) on research topics relevant to AI/ML safety. 
   
   My research interest is to develop trustworthy machine learning (AI/ML) models, for which I have worked on model robustness, explainability, and generalization to distribution shifts, etc. I have broad interests and experience in studying these problems for different ML systems, including vision-language models, large language models (LLMs), and image generative diffusion models. 

   During Ph.D., I have interned at Nvidia and Salesforce as a research intern. I am currently a student researcher at Google.

I am currently a student researcher at Google working with Dr. [Yaojie Liu](https://yaojieliu.github.io/) and Dr. [Vincent Chu](https://l2ior.github.io/).      -->
   
   Before UMD, I obtained my bachelor's degree in information security at the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC) in June 2019.

## News

* **[09/2023]** One paper accepted at NeurIPS. We studied a novel vulnerability of aligned language models from the perspective of data security. 
* **[11/2022]** In New Orleans attending NeurIPS. Will present the work done at Nvidia about prompt tuning for vision-language models. (Excited to attend my first in-person academic conference. I wish I had printed a bigger poster.)

## More about me (misc)

I enjoy doing yoga and meditation. I listen to classical music when focusing. I haven't played many video games, but I had great times playing The Legend of Zelda (BotW) and Stardew Valley.
